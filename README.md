Backend & Frontend is a developer with over 7 years of experience in development.
Highly experienced at all stages of the development lifecycle and end-to-end project management, from concept to development and delivery.
Known with flexibility and fast solutions using multiple software languages. A good team player who can quickly adapt to new advancements.

I have been using php for 6 years and I have used many frameworks, some of which are Laravel, CodeIgniter and Symfony.
I would like to use AJAX in the challenge you gave, I could write more effectively.

I added the data from the json file you sent to the sql table and made it editable, deleteable and new data.

I also added the newly added data to the json file and made it read frontend from the json file. This is because reading from json file is faster than reading it in sql table.

I could use Order By in query for filtering or I could use some php functions like array_slice() but it would not be efficient at this stage.

I guess I just missed writing php because of the habits of frameworks so thank you for this challenge.

I am currently experiencing a situation where I tried to integrate the data of 5 different companies into a single database and keep them updated for certain periods using cron. I'm working on a problem with the costs of managing big data so I completed the challenge a bit late, I'm sorry.
