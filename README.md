Backend & Frontend is a developer with over 7 years of experience in development. Highly experienced at all stages of the development lifecycle and end-to-end project management, from concept to development and delivery. Known with flexibility and fast solutions using multiple software languages. A good team player who can quickly adapt to new advancements.

I have been using php for 6 years and I have used many frameworks, some of which are Laravel, CodeIgniter and Symfony. I would like to use AJAX in the challenge you gave, I could write more effectively.

I can work as a junior developer for a minimum wage. I want to continue my career in Germany and improve my German.


I imported the json file and the database. I performed the insertion, deletion and editing operations in the database. I created a sample query field for the filtering field, you can see it on the index.php page. I can put the data from the example in the filtering field in a loop and collect the price parts and reflect it on the front side.



Best Regards,
Mert Dikmen
